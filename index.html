                            <p>I am Manraj, and I Co-founded <a href="https://www.socialzinc.com/"
                                    target="_blank">SocialZinc</a>, a data-driven influencer marketplace that is set to
                                revolutionize the industry. Our platform is now in its final stages of development, and
                                I assure
                                you that it will be worth the wait. And this is my personal homepage.
                            </p>

                            <p>My journey with SocialZinc began alongside my talented and humble Co-Founder, <a
                                    href=" https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepak-kr-vishwakarma/"
                                    target="_blank">Deepak</a>, a
                                tech wizard who excels in his field. Prior to SocialZinc, I had envisioned creating a
                                decentralized social media platform called <a href="https://seriamigo.com/"
                                    target="_blank">SeriAmigo</a>, which boasts a jaw-dropping user interface. Don't
                                miss out on
                                the opportunity to explore its incredible website</p>

                            <p>I am a foodie and a movie buff, with an unwavering love for both. Apart from these, I
                                enjoy
                                staying up-to-date with current events and have a keen interest in history and politics.
                                If you
                                haven't seen "Don't Look Up" yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch. I recently
                                enjoyed this
                                film, and it's definitely worth your time.</p>

                            <p>As an avid reader and audiobook enthusiast, I recently delved into "Doglapan" by Ashneer
                                Grover.
                                While it's a captivating read, it's important to note that it presents just one side of
                                his
                                story regarding his departure from Bharatpe. As I continue to embark on my own
                                entrepreneurial
                                journey, I plan to share my experiences and insights here and across my various social
                                media
                                accounts.</p>

                            <p>I'd like to leave you with a personal quote of mine: "Revolutionizing things is not a
                                simple
                                task, but remember to turn the sourest lemon in your life into something that resembles
                                lemonade." Let's embrace the challenges of innovation and make the world a better place,
                                one
                                step at a time.</p>
